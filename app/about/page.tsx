                    <p className="p-about">
                        Despite having an interest in all things Science and Engineering when I was younger, I chose to pursue
                        Physics, a decision driven by passion for wanting to know how things work, as well as the broad
                        range of disciplines encompassed.
                    </p>

                    <p className="p-about">
                        Fascinated by my subject, I now study BSc Physics at the University of Sheffield.
                    </p>

                    <p className="p-about">
                        Along with Physics, I have always had a hand in electronics and programming. My
                        skills reflect this, and over time has lead me towards Data Science and Analytics. During my
                        placement year, I experienced how influential data skills can be, where I was able to make an
                        immediate and significant impact to multiple aspects of design and quality,
                        using Physics and Data literacy.

                    <p className="p-about">
                        When I'm not immersed in projects, I like to play Saxophone, enjoy playing squash & going to
                        the gym.
